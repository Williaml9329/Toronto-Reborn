									<p>Creating affordable public transportation and ensuring that connections between the TTC is crucial for if we are to reduce poverty in the City of Toronto. Cars are expensive, and the many things that we have to pay for in order to drive could be used otherwise for other things. Things such as buying the car itself, gas, car insurance and more could be used to pay debts off, buy food for our children, and so much more. Also, without affordable and accessible public transportation, the taxes that low-income communities pay puts them at a disadvantage. When they pay taxes, a lot of the taxes will be used to maintain roads and highways. If these individuals cannot afford to drive, then who does it really benefit? The ones who are privileged enough to drive. If individuals pay taxes, they should expect the government to fund certain things that will help them, not put them at a disadvantage.</p>

									<p>Arguably, if public transportation is implemented correctly, it can help everyone in a city. Individuals who are middle to upper class can also benefit from this if they want to take public transportation as well. Everyone can benefit from the cheap transportation compared to expensive gas. Everyone can benefit from the simplicity and convience of public transportation. Public transportation can also provide a sense of freedom for teenagers and other kids who don't have access to cars or cannot drive yet. Instead of teenagers depending on their parents on driving them to various locations, they can go there themselves with accessible public transportation.</p>

									<h3 class="major">How can we ensure the transportation built in the city is useful?</h3>
									<p>Something we can do to ensure that beneficial transportation is built is by making the developers of street railways (streetcar lines) also the developers of new subdivisions they serve. Developers of new neighbourhoods then can best coordinate and know what transportation systems will benefit the residents living in them.</p>
