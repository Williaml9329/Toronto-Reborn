									<p>Basic income is a good idea to implement because it is the most efficient social program. There have been numerous times when funded social programs from taxpayers have failed to meet the needs of people. This is seen in Bill De Blasio’s ineffective attempt to overhaul New York City’s mental health system despite funding $850 million (Rayman et al., 2020). Instead of having singular programs to provide access to things from education to housing, basic income can be a broad program that provides all these needs. In terms of the mental health system, individuals can have autonomy in choosing a type of therapy with basic income, whether its: logotherapy, psychotherapy and more. Hence, UBI is a good idea to implement as it is a broad social program that benefits everyone while providing economic efficiency.
									</p>

									<p>Also, UBI is a beneficial idea because it can help with affordability. The Greater Toronto Area’s projected growth is 38% (Ontario’s Population Project, 2019). Since the planning approval process for new developments can be as long as 28 months, real estate prices in the GTA will likely increase (Marr, 2020). As the demand increases due to population growth and with the supply of housing not being abundant enough to meet demand, the price of real estate will increase so that both the consumer and producer surplus remains balanced. A balanced producer surplus will incentivize developers to build within the region. A basic income can provide individuals with enough income to ensure developers generate revenue, as opposed to cutting producer surplus with rent control. Thus, basic income can be a way for individuals in the Greater Toronto area to afford basic amenities that will soon likely increase in the near future, while still being able to give incentives to developers in the Greater Toronto Area.
									</p>

									<p>Universal basic income is a beneficial addition because it will maintain productivity in the workforce through maintaining mental health. Mental health problems can have an impact on “employers and businesses directly through increased absenteeism, negative impact on productivity and profits, as well as increase the costs to deal with the issue” (Rajgopal, 63-65). When individuals are inefficient and miss work, potential revenue is lost. Along with this, scarce funds that could have been used for other things will be used to treat these mental health problems. A basic income will allow the individual to make ends meet and provide them time to work on their passions to maintain mental health. When provided with these opportunities, individuals can grow both socially and emotionally, which will increase productivity in the workplace. Consequently, basic income is a viable addition to society as it maintains workplace productivity through managing the mental health of employers and employees.
