									<h3 class="major">Creating Mixed-Use Neighbourhoods</h3>
									<p>Through mixed-use neighbourhoods, we can ensure safe neighbourhoods while having a source of economic stimulus for the city. Think of neighbourhoods like Koreatown, Manhattan. Manhattan’s Koreatown consists of mid-rise buildings with commercial stores at street level. The abundant street life will both produce revenue for the city and make it hard for crime to be active in the area. This can do two things for those in poverty: provide much needed jobs, as well as provide potential funding for social services if the city chooses to allocate the generated revenue. Also, the additional housing units will aid the city with the affordability crisis and potentially provide housing for low-income individuals with housing units catered towards the lower class.</p>

									<p> Creating mixed-use neighbourhoods can also prevent poverty strongholds from forming in the city. A prime example of this was the King-Spadina area. The King-Spadina area was deemed as a "entertainment district," which caused the district to have the "rowdy, industrial-strength, late-night club scene." This ultimately caused many problems, such as outbreaks of violence at closing times and excessive drug abuse. Problems such as these can lower property values and create low-income areas, as the properties least in demand are generally the ones that low-income individuals move into. Ultimately, the conflicts in the area were caused by the hyper-concentration of use in a relatively confined area. In order to ensure that every area is safe and to make neighbourhoods throughout the neighbourhood relatively equal, we must create mixed-use neighbourhoods and communities.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Create Mixed-Income Neighbourhoods</h3>

									<p>Creating mixed-income neighbourhoods can ensure that those in poverty have equal access to services, amenities and public transportation. We live in a reality where the privileged and affluent have access to all these amenities, while those in poverty do not. If we can create equal neighbourhoods throughout the city and provide them with the necessary public services, everyone will have access to these and will be able to benefit from them. </p>

									<p>In order to do this, incentives for developers to build housing units that target the lower and middle class must be created. Providing housing units for the various income classes suggests the developer to sell housing units below the equilibrium price. This means that the city must provide incentives in order for this to happen, whether it’s through developer fees, subsidization and more. Despite this, it is crucial that this is done if we are to ensure a sufficient quality of life for everyone. <br>
