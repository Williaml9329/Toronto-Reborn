									<p>With denser cities, we can use less of our tax money to maintain the public realm while accommodating more individuals. Things such as: sewer pipes, roads, and electrical lines become more and more expensive to maintain as they stretch out. Densifying cities so that these accommodations can serve as many people as possible while using as little money as possible for these urban entities will ensure that we are using our money as efficiently as possible. Planned correctly with mixed-use, mixed-income communities, street level commercial stores can create a surplus of money to sustainably maintain the neighbourhood itself while using money towards inevitable problems in the near future. Having more people in an area can provide more tax revenue for the city, which then can be used for anything the city needs.</p>

									<p>Densifying will also justify and allow sufficient money to be generated in keeping public transportation affordable and sustainable. When density is sparse, it is hard for many public transportation companies to be sustainable economically as there aren't a sufficient amount of people taking it to generate a healthy income. With densifying, we can ensure that public transportation companies can generate a well-off revenue for them to stay active while using extra profits in expanding public transportation or providing upgrades. Without government bailouts/funding needed, we can allocate our budget for other things that are desperately needed, such as: infrastructure upgrades, funding of social programs, and more.</p>
