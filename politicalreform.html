									<p>Time and time again, the needs of cities have been neglected again and again. It all started in the 1980s, in which the Government of Canada made cutbacks in funding critical programs to the province. In turn, the Government of Ontario made budget cuts to their cities, which were lowest in their priorities. With cities being underfunded, another crucial event happened. The government at the time created the municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, in which all city services were administered together for the city of Toronto and the townships of York, East York, Scarborough, Etokicoke, and North York. The municipal government was then slashed, in which each city councillor acted as it’s own “city hall.” This has been detrimental for the development of Toronto. The municipal government was inefficient, inaccessible, and out of reach. Many solutions that were implemented by them were “one-fits-all” solutions, which created many problems in the city. An example of this would be the size of firetrucks, or the size of garbage bins. By implementing a “one size fits all” solution, the size of firetrucks could maneuver through suburban boroughs such as Scarborough, but in certain parts of downtown Toronto, such as Kensington Market, the firetrucks are unable to maneuver through. This is a big problem in our government that needs to be fixed. Certain districts in Toronto are unique, and require creative, unique solutions. Sometimes, one “size fits all solutions” won’t work. We need a sufficient amount of city councillors to ensure that every part of the city has enough feedback and creativity to solve problems throughout the unique districts of the city. This way, we can ensure that all parts of the city benefit.</p>

									<p>The government of Ontario should also give the City of Toronto more autonomy, or implement a “Urban Minister.” The vast majority of Ontario is rural, and Toronto is a very different place in it that requires very different needs and solutions. The solutions that the Government of Ontario implements may help certain areas but may be detrimental in urban areas such as the Greater Toronto Area. For example, creating car infrastructure in rural parts of Ontario may be beneficial for those areas, but in cities such as Toronto, the Gardiner Expressway is overloaded and desperately needs alternative modes of transportation to effectively deal with its traffic issues.
